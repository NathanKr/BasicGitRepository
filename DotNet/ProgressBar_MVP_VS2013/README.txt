this is an example of MVP for windows

implementation is for progress (as in CashProject) which has :
	- text header
	- progress bar
	- list box to show details from progress
	- close button

i did not finished implementation but is has the MVP structure

i did not used here UserAction as i did for android

these is one issue - how do i give each time new model because each time
progress is invoked with other logic . there may be few solutions :
-  bad solution is use some static field to put logic but there 
	may be other solutions
- other is simply pass Model via ProgressView CretaeView(......)
